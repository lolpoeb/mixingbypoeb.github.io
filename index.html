                    Mixing is a massive part of what makes your song
                    great, and a good mix is what will separate you from the thousands of songs that get released every
                    day.<br> This package will ensure every part of your song has its own place in the mix and bring
                    presence to sounds that were once hidden behind others.

                    <div class="aboutdesc">
                        My name is Blake (aka. poeb). I am 21 years old and live in Toowoomba, Queensland. I have been
                        making
                        music for the last 6 years and have found myself to have quite a keen ear for finding
                        imperfections in songs. I
                        love to help people get the sound they are looking for in their music and helping them learn the
                        same methods I use to get great sounding mixes.

                    <div class="missiondesc">
                        My mission is to make getting into music easier for the average person. I believe that anyone
                        with the right mindset and tools can create beautiful music that motivates and makes people
                        feel. I strive to be as transparent as possible with my clients and never intend to leave them
                        with a mix they arent happy with.
